# Bone - Age Predictor
Hereâ€™s a template for your GitHub README file, tailored for your bone age prediction model using the RSNA Bone Age dataset:

Bone Age Prediction Web Application
This repository contains the code for a web application that predicts bone age from X-ray images using a deep learning model. The application is built using Streamlit and TensorFlow, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time bone age assessment.

Overview
Bone age prediction is a crucial task in pediatric healthcare, helping to assess the growth and development of children. This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze X-ray images and predict the bone age of a patient. The web application allows users to upload X-ray images in PNG format and receive an immediate bone age prediction.

Features
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras for accurate bone age prediction.
Streamlit Interface: A simple and interactive web interface for uploading images and displaying predictions.
Real-Time Predictions: Upload an X-ray image and instantly get the predicted bone age.
Data Handling: Preprocessing of X-ray images includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation for enhanced model performance.
Dataset
The model is trained on the RSNA Bone Age dataset, which consists of X-ray images of pediatric patients. The dataset can be found on Kaggle:

RSNA Bone Age Dataset

View the predicted bone age in months.
Model Details
Architecture: The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple convolutional layers followed by dense layers for regression.
Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to minimize the difference between predicted and actual bone age.
Optimization: The Adam optimizer is employed for efficient gradient-based optimization.
Results
Validation Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The model achieved a validation MAE of 0.2562 months, demonstrating its accuracy in predicting bone age from X-ray images.
Future Enhancements
Model Improvement: Explore more advanced architectures such as ResNet or EfficientNet to further improve prediction accuracy.
Expand File Support: Add support for other image formats such as JPEG and TIFF.
Deployment: Deploy the application on a cloud platform for broader accessibility.
