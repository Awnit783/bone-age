## Bone Age Predictor using X-ray image

# 1. Problem Definition
  Age Prediction using x-Ray Using Deep Transfer Learning.

# 2. Data
@ The project leverages the [RSNA Bone Age Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/rsna-bone-age), a widely recognized dataset in medical imaging, to train and validate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The interface, built with `Streamlit`, allows users to interactively upload hand radiographs and receive bone age predictions.
