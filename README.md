# Bone Age Predictor using X-ray image

## 1. Problem Definition
  Age Prediction using x-Ray Using Deep Transfer Learning.

## 2. Data
@ The project leverages the [RSNA Bone Age Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/rsna-bone-age), a widely recognized dataset in medical imaging, to train and validate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

## Features

- **Interactive Web Interface:** Upload hand radiographs and get real-time bone age predictions.
- **Deep Learning:** Utilizes a CNN trained on the RSNA Bone Age Dataset and using 'imagenet' for fine turning the model to perform best. 
- **Easy Deployment:** Built using `Streamlit`, making it simple to run locally or deploy on cloud platforms.
- **Comprehensive Dataset:** Trained on a dataset with 12,000+ images, ensuring robust predictions.
