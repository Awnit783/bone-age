# Bone Age Predictor using X-ray image

## 1. Problem Definition
  Age Prediction using x-Ray Using Deep Transfer Learning.

## 2. Data
@ The project leverages the [RSNA Bone Age Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/rsna-bone-age), a widely recognized dataset in medical imaging, to train and validate a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

 ## ***Fine-Tuning Deep Learning Models for Age Prediction***
#### ~ Implemented Deep Learning and Transfer Learning by fine-tuning using imagenet and advance CNNs Models .
#### ~ Performed various experiments to determine the best model using  :- 
#####  *'loss: 0.2273'* ,
#####    *mae: 0.2854* ,
#####    *val_loss: 0.1413* ,
#####    *val_mae: 0.2562'*
